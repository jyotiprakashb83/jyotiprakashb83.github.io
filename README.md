My Current GITHUB projects: 
1. <a href="https://github.com/jyotiprakashb83/selenium-mcp-server-ai" target="_blank">Selenium MCP Server with AI </a>
This JAVA MAVEN TESTNG Project implements a Selenium Master Control Program (MCP) server in Java that executes browser automation tasks by converting natural language test steps into Selenium WebDriver commands using a Language Model (LLM). The server supports local Ollama or remote LLM endpoints and is configurable via property files. A TestNG-based client is included to send test prompts and log results.
